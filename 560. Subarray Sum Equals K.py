# Time: O(n) to loop throught the array and maintain a running sum
# Space: O(n) To maintain all the running sums

# Maintain a hashmap of the running sums and the time they have occured
# At a particular running sum check if we have y (i.e x - z is the current running sum and z is the target)
# If we have y check how many times it has occered cause the frequency conveys the times the sum of array is then imcrement the count
# z = y + x we have y as target and z as the runnning sum as a particular iteration
# So to find x it's x = z- y
